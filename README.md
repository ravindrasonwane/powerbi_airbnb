## Problem Statement

This dashboard provides insights into Airbnb's property listings, host performance, pricing, and customer engagement across different neighborhoods. By analyzing these metrics, Airbnb can optimize pricing strategies, improve customer experience, and maximize occupancy rates.

Since some hosts or locations may underperform in terms of occupancy or reviews, this dashboard helps pinpoint areas for improvement. It enables better targeting of marketing efforts, inventory management, and dynamic pricing adjustments.

Additionally, if certain room types or regions show lower engagement, Airbnb can focus on offering competitive pricing, discounts, and service enhancements to boost bookings and revenue.
